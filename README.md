# WPILogViewer

Fair Warning, this software is fairly rough, and still very much a WIP. If you are here looking for a way to visualize data from WPILib Logs and the year is 2022, then you will probably be better off exporting to CSV using the Datalog tool.

Must have LabVIEW 2020 runtime environment. This is already installed if you have the FRC Game Tools (ni.com/frc)
